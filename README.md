# Apriori Algorithm

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the apriori algorithm. 
Which is used in datamining to find frequent itemsets in a database.

## How to use the project
The Algorithm needs to be given a file path of the database and a minimum support threshold
to output the frequent itemsets, and time it took.


## How to run the project
the command to run the project is `java apriori ./file.txt 10` where file.txt is the file that holds the database
and 10 is the minimum support threshold. 

## compilation
the files Apriori, Combinations, FileReadWrite, ListCreation, ListOfItems and Stopwatch must be compiled for the program to work
